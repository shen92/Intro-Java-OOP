his assignment will give you practice with defining interfaces, super classes, and subclasses. We are going to add a new interface, new classes, and new features with respect to JunglePark 1000 application. We¡¯ll work also on improving the clarity and organization of our code. Having this programming assignment as reference, you will be also able to develop a graphical application that extends the PApplet class defined in the processing library, from the scratch. We no longer need to use the Utility class provided for you in the CS300JunglePark.jar file in P2. JunglePark 2000 includes different animals. In addition to the Tigers, we will have Deers. After completing assignment, you may add other kinds of animals such as lions, giraffes, monkeys, etc. Note that animals within our JunglePark application share common properties and common features. But, they act differently in the park. Each animal has a specific behavior indeed. We are going to define and implement those similarities and differences in this assignment. We are also going to add new graphic components to our application, such as buttons.
