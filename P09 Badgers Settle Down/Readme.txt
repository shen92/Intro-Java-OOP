In this assignment you will help badgers settle down into a sett.  Since larger badgers have an easier time staying warm in the winter, we¡¯ve decided to organize them into the northern right-most rooms within the sett.  And smaller badgers will be in the southern left-most rooms.  To help manage this, we will be using a Binary Search Tree (BST) organization that is ordered by the badgers¡¯ size.
