In this assignment we are going to implement a very simple version of a process scheduler that employs the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling policy. Job or process scheduling policies are used to dequeue the most appropriate job to execute next. In particular, Shortest Job First (SJF), or shortest job next scheduling policy selects the ready process with the smallest execution time (aka burst time) to execute next.
