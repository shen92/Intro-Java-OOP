This assignment involves developing a graphical application that simulates the behavior of a set of animals (tigers, lions, deer, and giraffes, for instance) in a jungle park. For this week, we¡¯ll focus on developing an application named Jungle Park 1000 that allows the user to add up to 8 tigers to the jungle park area, and move them arbitrary within the display window using the mouse. No specific action or behavior will be defined for this animal at this stage.
