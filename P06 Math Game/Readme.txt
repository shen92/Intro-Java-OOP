For this assignment, you will be implementing a math game in which the player is presented with a list of numbers and a target goal number.  The player will choose one of these numbers along with an operator: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), division (/), or concatenation (&).  The chosen number will then be combined with the number following it in the list using the specified operator, so that two list elements become one.  Before these nodes are combined, a new randomly chosen value is added to the end of the list, so that the final length of the list remains the same.  The player makes repeated choices like this, until the target number appears as one of the values within the list.
